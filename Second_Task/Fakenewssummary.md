- I have created this model by using a dataset of true and fake news articles that had approximately 40000 entries. 
- I have used two types of vectorization techniques to convert the text into numerical form: Word2Vec and TF-IDF.
- I have trained Random Forest Classifier model on these processed data.
- I have deployed the project on streamlit.
- Here's the deployed link: https://realhaiyafake.streamlit.app/
